.gitignore

This project includes a .gitignore configured for Unity. It excludes:

Unity-generated folders (Library/, Temp/, Obj/, Builds/, etc.)

IDE/system files (.vs/, .vscode/, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)

Large build outputs and cache files

Extra media files (e.g., .mp4, .srt)

This keeps the repository clean and ensures only Assets, ProjectSettings, and necessary documentation are tracked.
